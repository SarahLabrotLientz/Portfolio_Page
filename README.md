# Portfolio_Page

This portfolio page is a work in progress. The assignment was to create a page with navigation, contact section and about me. This was achieved using html/CSS. 


However, I would like to implement bootstrap into this site after this assignment. The instructor told us to leave it out for now so my code got a little messy. Hopefully, when we do start using bootstrap my code will make more sense. In the meantime, I was please with the simplicity and hope you are too. Enjoy!

Created a GitHub repository for my Portfolio Page: https://github.com/SarahLabrotLientz/Portfolio_Page
